## Introduction
This is an open source classification based metric toolbox based on Python and Numpy.

## Features
- The toolbox contains most commonly used metrics in classification tasks in model training 
  and evaluation, including accuracy, confusion matrix with associated analysis, F-beta score, 
  precision-recall curve, ROC curve, etc.
  
- The metrics covers tasks like binary classification, multiclass classification and 
  multilabel classification, etc, can be called in model training process or evaluation 
  in model analysis period.
  
- The architecture is based on Python and Numpy, so the toolbox is not limited to the 
  framework used in model training or evaluation.
